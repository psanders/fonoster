Lets Encrypt Step by Ste

Download and install `certbot` and then run the following steps

1. Generate the certificates using the following command:

`sudo certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns`

For this to work you will have to manually add dns entry. All generated files
will be located at /etc/letsencrypt.

2. Next step is to convert the certificate chain + private key to the PKCS#12 file format
and then put it into the Java keystore.

`openssl pkcs12 -export -out keystore.pkcs12 -in fullchain.pem -inkey privkey.pem`

and

`keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore keystore.pkcs12 -srcstoretype PKCS12 -destkeystore fonoster.keystore`

(you can remove keystore.pkcs12 is not needed anymore)

3. Remember to obfuscate the password by running the following command:

`java -cp lib/jetty-util-xxx.jar org.eclipse.jetty.util.security.Password thepassword`

(if you replace the parameter by an obfucasted string you can deobfuscate i.e "OBF:20771x1b206z")

4. Install the file in te `etc` of jetty and update the start.ini
